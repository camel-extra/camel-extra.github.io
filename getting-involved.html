<h3>How can I become a committer</h3>

<h3>Responsibilities of a committer</h3>

<h4>Decide on release plans and releases</h4>

<p>One of the major responsibilities of a committer is to decide when a branch of code is ready for release. Beside the fact, that camel-extra follows the release cycle of ASF Camel, there is also a need of having sufficient product quality since all releases are publicly distributed and serve others when developing great software. Therefore committers have the responsibility for testing new releases before we make it available for everyone.</p>

<h4>Applying patches</h4>

<p>In order to grow and maintain a healthy community, committers need to discuss, review and apply patches submitted by volunteers. Committers are also responsible for the quality and IP clearance of the code that goes into the repository.</p>

<h4>Helping users</h4>

<p>Committers should monitor the mailing list for the project they work on and collectively provide timely and useful responses to questions from users.</p>

<h4>Monitoring commits and issues</h4>

<p>Committers should review commit messages and point out anything that looks funny or that may bring in IP issues. In addition, the monitoring of the issue tracker is also a responsibility of a committer.</p>

<h4>Helping out with the website</h4>

<p>The website of camel-extra is in constant need of maintenance. Committers on a project are expected to collectively maintain the website and provide sufficient information on documentation.</p>
